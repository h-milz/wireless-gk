# Components

  * MCU: an [ESP32-C6](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-c6)  based MCU with u.fl connector for an external antenna to avoid hacking an [external antenna mod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4mtrueU6eM)). This MCU sports two RISC-V cores one of which runs at 160 MHz, the other at 20 MHz (ultra-low-power). This sounds feeble but in reality it is [slightly faster](https://github.com/nopnop2002/esp-idf-benchmark) (at least in Dhrystones) than the ESP32-S3, and it supports 2.4 GHz [WiFi6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_6) 802.11ax (up to HT20/MCS9) which was specifically engineered for IoT solutions in noisy environments.  **Remark**: The ESP32-C6 has a hardware limitation which supports 8 I2S/TDM slots only in 16 bit resolution, 5 slots at 24 bit and 4 slots at 32, and it has only one I2S controller compared to the two of the ESP32-S3  which has the same limitation otherwise. Only the upcoming [ESP32-C5](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/ESP32-C5) and -C61 MCUs may have so such limitation according to the code that's already in the ESP-IDF. So for production, the C5 is the way to go but development will take place with two C6 boards and a 2-channel ADC/DAC pair. An alternative (in particular if the C5 does not support 8 slots / 24 bits) would be to bite the bullet and reduce the resolution to 16 bits. This would reduce the S/N rate by a mere 10 dB, and in a stage situation, this may be regarded as irrelevant. Not so in the studio where you can (and should!) always use the cable. (As a small comfort, this would reduce the overall latency due to smaller packet sizes on the WiFi.) 
   
  * ADC: AKM [AK5538VN](https://www.akm.com/eu/en/products/audio/audio-adc/ak5538vn/) 8-channel audio ADC which is [I2S / TDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2S) capable. Sadly, it is not in stock at my favourite PCB maker (see **Building Prototypes** below). An 8-ch. alternative would be Cirrus Logic's CS5368 but this part uses 2 power supply voltages and much more power. Their better (low power, single supply) successor part CS5308P was announced in summer 2023 but it wasn't even available as samples in April 2024. 

  * DAC: AKM [AK4458VN](https://www.akm.com/eu/en/products/audio/audio-dac/ak4458vn/) 8-ch audio DAC (same sourcing problem as with the 5538).  Alternatively, a [Texas Instruments / Burr-Brown PCM1691](https://www.ti.com/product/de-de/PCM1681-Q1). 

  * a couple of low-noise op-amps like TL074 or OPA4134 or any other low-noise type with the same standard footprint. Or maybe the same NJM2068D's that Roland uses. 

  * some power management chips for LiPo charging and creating supply voltages.
 
Primarly for marketing reasons, everything will work with 24 bit resolution, 44.1 kHz sample rate. The VG-99 and the GR-55 work with these parameters, and it would be hard to advertise a device that does less, although from a technical standpoint 16/32 or 16/36 would probably be enough. The downside to this is, it will require a higher over-the-air bandwidth.
