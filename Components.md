# Components

  * MCU: an [ESP32-C5](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/ESP32-C5) module with u.fl connector for an external antenna. The chip was announced in spring 2022 but is not available yet. According to the [information there is](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-dev-kits/en/latest/esp32c5/esp32-c5-devkitc-1/user_guide.html), this MCU sports two RISC-V cores one of which runs at 240 MHz, the other at 20 MHz (ultra-low-power), and it will support 5 GHz WiFi6 (i.e. 802.11ax). Until it is available (I don't expect it to be generally available before early 2025), development and testing will take place with its smaller sibling, the C6 (also WiFi6, but only 2.4 GHz). The ESP32-C6 has a hardware limitation which supports 8 I2S/TDM slots only in 16 bit resolution, 5 slots at 24 bit and 4 slots at 32, and it has only one I2S controller compared to the two of the ESP32-S3 which has the same limitation otherwise. Espressif confirmed on my request that the ESP32-C5 will have no such limitation, but support 16 channels with 32 bits of resolution in a single I2S controller. 
     
  * ADC: AKM [AK5538VN](https://www.akm.com/eu/en/products/audio/audio-adc/ak5538vn/) 8-ch audio ADC which is [I2S / TDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2S) capable. The chip is available from DigiKey or Mouser. 

  * DAC: AKM [AK4458VN](https://www.akm.com/eu/en/products/audio/audio-dac/ak4458vn/) 8-ch audio DAC. The chip is available from DigiKey or Mouser. 

  * a couple of low-noise op-amps like NE5532 or NJM2068. (available everywhere)

  * some power management chips for LiPo charging and creating supply voltages.
 

## Sample Rate
  
Primarly for marketing reasons, everything will work with 24 bit resolution and, 44.1 kHz sample rate. The VG-99 and the GR-55 work with these parameters, and it would be hard to advertise a device that does less, although from a technical standpoint 16/32 or 16/36 would probably be enough. The downside to this is, it will require a higher over-the-air bandwidth. 

The ESP32 MCLK may have considerable jitter given that it is generated by a fractional divider when using a non-integer value of master clock divided by sample rate.  In order to prevent this for good, I will use 11.2896MHz standard oscillators for generating the master clock and have either the ADC (in the sender) or the ESP32 module (in the reciver) generate the remaining clocks. These oscillators with +/- 10 ppm tolerance cost less than a dollar, so I don't think it makes sense to take any risk.
