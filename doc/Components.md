# Components

  * MCU: [ESP32-C5](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/ESP32-C5) modules with u.fl connector for an external antenna. The chip was announced in spring 2022 but is not commercially available yet, but should be around mid-2025. According to the [information there is](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-dev-kits/en/latest/esp32c5/esp32-c5-devkitc-1/user_guide.html), this MCU sports two RISC-V cores one of which runs at 240 MHz, the other at 20 MHz (ultra-low-power), and it will support 5 GHz WiFi6 (i.e. 802.11ax). In 2H2025, ESP32-C5 modules should be available in pretty much every IoT shop. 
     
  * ADC: AKM [AK5538VN](https://www.akm.com/eu/en/products/audio/audio-adc/ak5538vn/) 8-ch audio ADC which is [I2S / TDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2S) capable. The chip is available from DigiKey or Mouser. 

  * DAC: AKM [AK4458VN](https://www.akm.com/eu/en/products/audio/audio-dac/ak4458vn/) 8-ch audio DAC. The chip is available from DigiKey or Mouser. 

  * a couple of low-noise op-amps like NE5532 or NJM2068. (available everywhere)

  * some power management chips for LiPo charging and creating supply voltages.

  * attaching the device will require a short GK cable of about 50 cm length. Such cables seem not to be available on the market, which means we will have to make our own stubs. In this case, as an option we could use 15-pin DB connectors (VGA connectors) which are much more rugged and smaller. 
 

## Sample Rate
  
Primarly for marketing reasons, everything will work with 24 bit resolution and, 44.1 kHz sample rate. The VG-99 and the GR-55 work with these parameters, and it would be hard to advertise a device that does less, although from a technical standpoint 16/32 or 16/36 would probably be enough. The downside to this is, it will require a higher over-the-air bandwidth. 

The ESP32 MCLK may have considerable jitter given that it is generated by a fractional divider when using a non-integer value of system clock divided by master clock.  In order to prevent this for good, I will use 11.2896 or 22.5792 MHz standard oscillators for generating the master clock fed into the ESP32, which then creates the remaining clocks BCLK and WS. These oscillators with +/- 10 ppm tolerance cost less than a dollar, so I don't think it makes sense to fool around with fractional dividers.
